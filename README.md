# React Youtube Clone

This is my implementation of the React Youtube Clone as described in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb1zVeXLUf8). The video implements a clone of Youtube both in terms of design and functionality. The app is able to grab the latest videos from Youtube, play the videos, display Channel information and show video comments. This functionality is powered by the Youtube Data API (the setup is described below).

## Skills

- React (components, props, useState and useEffect)
- React Router (routes, links, useParams)
- CSS (selectors, nested selectors, flexbox and grid, media queries)

## Youtube Data API

To obtain an API key follow the steps outlined in [this document](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started). You will require a google account and authorisation credentials. It is recommended to create an email account specifically for coding projects as this will normally require you to reduce the security of your gmail account.

## Extensions

For a potential upgrade of this project one could also consider the ideas from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymGB1lqP1CM) which incorporates additional interactivity and styling, powered by a combination of tailwind and more advanced react features. The current implementation uses Raw CSS.
